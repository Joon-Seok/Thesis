### Background

- Growing demend of indoor *location based-services* (LBSs)
  * Complex indoor sites such as convention centers, shopping malls and subway stations
  * Infrastructure and mobile devices that enable indoor positioning
- Threat to privacy when using LBS through untrusted location-based service provider (LSP)
- Existing work is not efficient to apply to indoor spaces

### What is limitation of previous work?

1. Difference in distance matric
2. Improper form of ASR
3. Query processing for indoor location *K*-anonymity

### Scope

- Query type: 
  * r-range query in indoor distance
  * k-nearest neighbor query in indoor distance
- Target to protect:
  * Location K-anonymity (re-identification)
  * Cell l-diversity (semantic information)
- Spatial extent of ASR:
  * Room level
  * 3-dimensional space as well as 2-dimensional
- Responsibility: Trusted third party (centralized approach)
- Attack model:
  * Center-of-ASR atack
  * Replay attack
