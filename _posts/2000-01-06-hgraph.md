## Factors of K-Anonymization

1. Security against inference attacks
  - It is important to ensure that the identity of the requester should not be exposed with a probability larger than 1/K.
2. Performance of query processing
  - The area of ASR should be minimized for the performance of query processing


Strategy of Generating H-Graph: Minimize inefficiency

- Less average branching factor for performance
- Balanced for security

Measure of H-Graph: inefficiency = bf x height

## Generating Base Graph

In order to generate the hierarchical graph, a base graph is required first.


## Algorithm of Generating H-Graph

1. Select victim nodes which should be merged in priority.
2. Select target nodes that will be merged with the victim nodes.
