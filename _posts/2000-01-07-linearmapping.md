### Considerations for Linear Mapping in Indoor Space

1. To partition indoor spaces into cells recursively
2. To reflect indoor distance matric
3. To assign a high priority to cluster objects in the same cell
4. To minimize sume of indoor distance


### Linear mapping using H-Graph

Algorithm

{% highlight html linenos=table %}

candidiate = MinimumDistanceSum(G);
